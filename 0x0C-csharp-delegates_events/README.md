## Resources
Read or watch:

Delegates (C# Programming Guide) (Read all sections “Using Delegates”, “Delegates with Named vs Anonymous Methods”, “How to: Combine Delegates”, “How to Declare, Instantiate, and Use a Delegate”)
Why Delegates? Why Not Call Methods Directly?
Events (C# Programming Guide) (Read sections “How to Subscribe to and Unsubscribe from Events”, “How to: Raise Base Class Events in Derived Classes”, and “How to: Implement Interface Events”)
Standard .NET event patterns
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
What are delegates and how to use them
What are anonymous methods and how to use them
What is multicasting
What is the difference between delegates and interfaces
What is a callback
What are events and how to use them
What is asynchronous programming

## Requirements
Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
You can organize and name your files as you like for this project, just ensure you do not push a file containing a Main method, it may conflict with our testing files.
Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your Github and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
In the following examples, the main.cs files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.cs files at compilation. Our main.cs files might be different from the one shown in the examples
All your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
All your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags
